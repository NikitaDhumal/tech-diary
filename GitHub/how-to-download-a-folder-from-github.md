If you find yourself in a situation where you want to download a folder from GitHub repository, but not the entire repository itself, you can use a tool like [Download Directory Github](https://download-directory.github.io/).

To download a folder from GitHub, navigate to your desired repository, select the folder you want to download from GitHub, copy the URL, navigate to https://download-directory.github.io/ and paste the URL into the text box, and hit enter.
