### MySQL Joins

A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.

There are several types of joins in MySQL:

- INNER JOIN: Returns only the matching rows from both tables.
- LEFT JOIN: Returns all the rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table.
- RIGHT JOIN: Returns all the rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table.
- FULL OUTER JOIN: Returns all the rows from both tables, including the unmatched rows.
- CROSS JOIN: Returns the Cartesian product of both tables, resulting in a combination of all rows from both tables.
